# React Beginner Project README

Welcome to the React Beginner Project! This project serves as an introduction to building React applications for beginners. It covers fundamental concepts such as creating components, handling events, and managing state using the React library within an HTML environment.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the basics of building a React application using HTML and the React library. It includes sample code snippets showcasing the creation of components, event handling, and state management.

## Project Structure

```

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-beginner-project
    ```

3. Open the `file.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Components

The project utilizes React components to create reusable UI elements. Components are the building blocks of React applications, encapsulating their own state and behavior.


### 2. Events

React allows you to handle user interactions (events) using event handlers. These handlers are functions that execute in response to specific events, such as clicks or input changes.


### 3. State

State represents the data that a component needs to render dynamically. React components can manage their own state, which allows for interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
